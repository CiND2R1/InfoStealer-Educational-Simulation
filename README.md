# InfoStealer Educational Simulation 🧠🔐

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**  
> This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
> It is intended to help cybersecurity learners understand how infostealer malware typically works in a controlled, simulated, and ethical way.  
> **Do not use or execute this script on real systems, production environments, or against others under any circumstances.**  
> Use only in isolated virtual machines or lab environments for analysis and defensive study.

## 📚 What Is This?

This is a **simulated Python script** that shows how malicious actors might extract sensitive information like:

- Chrome saved passwords
- Wi-Fi credentials
- Clipboard contents
- System screenshots

It also demonstrates:
- Data exfiltration via Discord webhook
- Persistence through Windows startup
- Zipping and cleanup of stolen data

The purpose is to learn **how these techniques work**, so we can better detect, prevent, or simulate them in red team / blue team settings.
